# [Villag](http://vill.ag)

Villag is a network of tools for communities built and used by Denton, Texans.

Think of Villag as a town square, a central location where community members can find tools (websites, mobile apps, documentation, and more) for their ... village, be it a city or any sort of organization.

## Villag Values

* Transparency
* Participation
* Collaboration

Communities are organic in their creation and their growth, and so each of these values are important to our success.

## Who is Villag?

Villag is a community project led by citizens of Denton, TX. We make tools for our city in mind, but your community can use our tools also!

Because Villag is open source everyone is welcome to participate, but Villag does have a steering committee led by Patrick Daly, Darren Smitherman, and Dave Sims. The steering committee helps to cast Villag's vision, approve pull requests, and generally lead our community to develop great tools.
